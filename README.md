# Solutions: codeforces.com problemset

In this repo I've published all my solutions from codeforces.com problemset (since 2013). Most of the tasks were solved using C++, Java and Python programming languages. Solutions grouped by folders (i.e. programming language name) and each filename actually is a unique id of task from problemset (e.g. 123A.java, 234B.py, 345A.cpp etc.). The link to the task can be found in the source code of each solution (first line).
